[Still in Beta] [v2.3]
   - [FIX] Removed the non-functional 'ParticleEmitter' from the UI. It was dead
      code as particles do not render inside ScreenGuis. This cleans up the script
      and removes misleading function calls.
    - [FIX] Patched a critical memory leak in the 'RenderStepped' event. The connection
      is now properly disconnected when the loader finishes or is destroyed, preventing
      connections from stacking on re-execution.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] Hardened the whitelist authentication logic. It now checks for an
      exact UserID match on each line, preventing false positives where one ID is a
      substring of another (e.g., '123' matching '51234').
    - [FORMATTING] Performed a full formatting pass to ensure maximum readability,
      with logical code blocks clearly separated for easier debugging and modification.
