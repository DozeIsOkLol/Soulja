[Still in Beta] 
    Changelog v2.8:
    - [ARCHITECTURE] Replaced `SafeHttpGet` with `RobustHttpGet`, which automatically
      retries failed HTTP requests. This makes the loader highly resilient to
      temporary network errors.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] The main ScreenGui is now parented to the PlayerGui immediately
      at the start of UI creation, following best practices to prevent any potential
      engine race conditions with animations.
    - [IMPROVEMENT] Enhanced error logging for script execution to explicitly state
      which URL failed to download, aiding in faster debugging.
    - [FEATURE] Implemented a multi-game loading system with a universal fallback.
